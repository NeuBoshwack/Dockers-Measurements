<p>The Measurements are going to be for A1312-0035 and A1312-0006 both sized 32x30, 
not all measurements will apply to other pairs. But the Rise and pocket measurements, 
as well as zipper measurement should be accurate close to all of our men's pants that aren't collection items or a part of the Big and Tall products we offer. </p>
