 <p>The first set of Measurements is going to be for <a href="https://us.dockers.com/products/comfort-knit-chinos-straight-fit-a13120035" target_blank>A1312-0035</a> sized 32x30, 
 not all measurements will apply to other pairs. With that said the Rise(As long as the pair in question "Hits at your waist" but most are), pocket measurements, zipper measurement 
 and leg opening should be close to all of our men's pants in a similar fit that aren't collection items or a part of the Big and Tall products we offer. </p>
